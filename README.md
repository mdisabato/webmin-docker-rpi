# webmin-docker-rpi
Run Webmin in a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi

This is based on the following projects: 

  https://github.com/c2theg/docker-webmin
  https://github.com/amazon/webmin-docker

As of 24 Dec 2021, I have placed this project on hold. The current implementation works, but has some performance issues.
